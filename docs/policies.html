<section id="diversity-and-inclusion-policy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="diversity-and-inclusion-policy">Diversity and inclusion policy</h2>
<p>The Organisers acknowledge that the workforce in STEM fields (including mathematics and computer science) does not reflect the diversity of the general population, and the importance of role models in encouraging talents to pursue careers in STEM regardless of their background. ​ This document outlines the steps the Organising Committee is taking in order to make the event accessible and welcoming to a diverse crowd, independently of ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.</p>
<p>We encourage anyone with concerns regarding accessibility, diversity, or inclusion to contact the Organising Committee.</p>
<p>Note: this document is not final and will be subject to changes by the time of the event.</p>
</section>
<section id="speaker-and-mentors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="speaker-and-mentors">Speaker and mentors</h2>
<p>​ The Organisers are committed to inviting speakers and mentors representative of all people. This includes ensuring a diverse representation of research subjects and fields, gender, and ethnic backgrounds among our speakers and mentors.</p>
<p>In particular, we attempt to counteract the underrepresentation of women in STEM by making sure that at least 20% of speakers and mentors are non-male. We also strongly encourage applications by non-men and minorities and will reserve 20% of the participant spots for underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>The Organisers will, to the best of their abilities, ensure traditionally under-represented groups in AI and STEM are aware of the event and encouraged to apply, e.g., by reaching out to university and department diversity officers.</p>
</section>
<section id="disabilities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="disabilities">Disabilities</h2>
<p>​ The Organisers are committed to making the event accessible to people with disabilities. We will strive to provide accessible versions of the content of the summer school (e.g.&nbsp;plain-text pages with links to the videoconference meetings). We also have funding available for individualised assistance.</p>
<p>Please reach out to the organisers if you require help with accessibility.</p>
</section>
<section id="caring-responsibilities" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="caring-responsibilities">Caring responsibilities</h2>
<p>​ Financial support will be available to relieve participants, mentors or speakers of caring responsibilities that might interfere with their participation in the Summer School. Applicants can state in the application form that they request financial assistance to cover caring expenses in order to attend the event. Attendance will also be provided for free to legal carers of participants if requested in the application form.</p>
<p>Please reach out to the organisers if you require help with caring responsibilities.</p>
</section>
<section id="financial-support" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="financial-support">Financial support</h2>
<p>​ Limited financial support is available. Preference will be given to applicants who cannot obtain financial assistance by other means (e.g.&nbsp;from their university, department, or advisors). Applicants will have the possibility to apply for support in the application form. ​</p>
</section>
<section id="code-of-conduct" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>This document states the Code of Conduct of the LOGML 2022 Workshop (hereafter referred to as “the Event”).</p>
<p>Note: This document is not final and will be subject to changes by the time of the event.</p>
<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>​ The Organisers are committed to making this conference productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, or religion. For this reason, we will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, and will implement policies to promote an inclusive environment and support vectors for attendees who require assistance to participate in the workshop.</p>
<p>As part of the registration process, all attendees (i.e.&nbsp;all participants, mentors, speakers, any volunteer helpers, and any other person attending the event) are required to agree to adhere to this Code of Conduct. In particular, Sponsors are equally subject to this Code of Conduct, and may not use images, activities, or any other materials that are of sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature. This code applies both to official Sponsors as well as any organisation that uses the Workshop name, image, or identity as part of its activities at or around the Workshop.</p>
</section>
<section id="code-of-conduct-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-of-conduct-1">Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>​ Attendees are required to behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes and any behaviour pertaining to bullying are not appropriate. Compliance with these principles and, in particular, with the present Code of Conduct is expected not just for virtual meetings, but also for interactions on social media.</p>
<p>Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, sustained unwanted contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, pressuring, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. It also includes offensive or belittling comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, or religion.</p>
<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="incident-reporting-and-resolution" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incident-reporting-and-resolution">Incident reporting and resolution</h2>
<p>​ If you observe someone making you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please tell them so, and remind them of the Code of Conduct. Non-confrontational alternatives can be to create a distraction, or to refer the person to an Organiser.</p>
<p>Whether or not you addressed the person yourself, report incidents as soon as possible to a member of the Organising Committee - see contact information below. The Committee is committed to addressing and resolving the matter to the best of their abilities and within the best possible delay. We are prepared to help participants in contacting relevant help services, and to escort them to a safe location.</p>
<p>Please use the following contact information, and explain what happened and who was involved so that we can investigate: <a href="mailto:logml.committee@gmail.com">logml.committee@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>The phone number of the point of contact will be provided to all attendees as part of the electronic materials during the Event. ​ ## Sanctions ​ When someone is asked to stop any behaviour that violates the Code of Conduct, they are expected to comply immediately. In response to behaviour deemed inappropriate by the Organising Committee (e.g.&nbsp;sexual content, rudeness, unprofessional), the Organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the person in question, asking them to leave or banning them from the event, or removing them from a mailing list.</p>
<p>Specific actions may include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>asking the person to cease the inappropriate behaviour, and warning them that any further reports will result in other sanctions</p></li>
<li><p>requiring the person makes conciliatory efforts that may include an apology, informal mediation, or other steps intended to facilitate restoration of relationships</p></li>
<li><p>requiring the person avoids any interaction with another person for the remainder of the event</p></li>
<li><p>early termination of a talk that violates the policy</p></li>
<li><p>not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violates the policy</p></li>
<li><p>not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event</p></li>
<li><p>immediately ending any event responsibilities or privileges held</p></li>
<li><p>requiring that the person immediately leave the event and not return</p></li>
<li><p>blocking the person on social media platforms</p></li>
<li><p>banning the person from future events</p></li>
<li><p>publishing an anonymous account of the harassment</p></li>
<li><p>reporting the incident to the person’s employer</p></li>
<li><p>reporting the incident to competent authorities</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Organisers reserve the right to remove participants who fail to comply with the Code of Conduct if the situation requires it. The Organisers may decline to refund any cost incurred with attendance (including, e.g., registration fee) to participants who have been expelled for breaching the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Thank you for your participation in the LOGML community, and your efforts to keep our conference welcoming, respectful, and friendly for all participants!</p>
