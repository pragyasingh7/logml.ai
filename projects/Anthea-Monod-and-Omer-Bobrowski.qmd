## Project

Topological data analysis (TDA) is a field within data science that adapts algebraic topology to computation, data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, with a purpose to reveal intrinsic geometric features within complex datasets.
This project will study the task of tracking such features in comparative settings, referred to as cycle matching (or cycle registration)—identifying topological structures that two datasets have in common—in machine learning.

Recently, statistically and computationally amenable approaches to cycle matching have been proposed [1,2], which work well for low-dimensional, naturally aligned data (such as 2D slices of 3D images or time series of images).
However, neural activation patterns challenge this framework: they are extremely high-dimensional, lack natural alignment, and often exhibit varying intrinsic dimensionalities.

This project will revisit the problem of cycle matching for neural network activations both in terms of its mathematical definition and its computational approach. 
The goal will be to develop new definitions and algorithms that are robust to the challenges posed by high-dimensional, unaligned point clouds geared towards a tractable tool to study the intricate structure of neural activations. 
We will proceed by concurrently tackling theoretical questions of redefining cycle matching as well as computational approaches on both synthetic data and real-world, publicly available activation data on state-of-the-art LLMs (Phi 3 3.8, Mistral 7B, LLaMA 8B) under adversarial influences [3].

Such a methodology would result in a twofold impact: (i) we will be able to track the flow of information across different layers of neural networks, providing insights into how models process and transform data and interpreting model latent space, which will have concrete utility in better understanding adversarial influences, for instance; and (ii) the increase in subsampling efficiency will lead to proved topological-statistical estimates while reducing computational overhead, which will be adaptable in full generality of applications beyond understanding how neural networks train and learn.
