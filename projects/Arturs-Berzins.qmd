## Arturs Berzins

Arturs Berzins is a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Machine Learning at JKU Linz. 
Arturs research is focused on the intersection of machine learning, geometry, and simulation. 
He received a PhD in mathematics from the University of Oslo for the thesis on Neural Representations in Geometry. 
His PhD was hosted by the Geometry group at SINTEF as a fellow of GRAPES â€” a Marie Sklodowska-Curie ITN on Learning, processing and optimising shapes. 
Previously, Arturs received his BSc and MSc in mechanical engineering from RWTH Aachen specializing in simulation technology.


## Project

A neural network consisting of piecewise affine building blocks, such as fully-connected layers and ReLU activations, is itself a piecewise affine function supported on a polyhedral complex. 
This complex is used to study the theoretical properties of neural networks and in applied geometry, but, in practice, extracting it has been challenging due to its high combinatorial complexity. 
A natural idea described in previous works is subdividing the regions via intersections with hyperplanes induced by each neuron. 
However, [1] argues that subdividing regions leads to computational redundancy and proposes to subdivide edges instead. 
The resulting "edge subdivision" method uses standard GPU accelerated tensor operations and improves the speed over previous methods by an order of magnitude.

Several avenues remain to improve edge subdivision further, including the generalization to unbounded domains, non-generic arrangements, and other piecewise affine architectures, as well as improving pruning strategies for more efficient extraction of level-sets. 
The integration of hashing in a specific sub-routine could potentially improve the performance significantly. 
This improved performance and the differentiability of the method would allow us to consider new use-cases after or during the training, such as for adversarial robustness, grokking, shape representations, or geometric optimization.
