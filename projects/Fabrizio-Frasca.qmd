## Fabrizio Frasca

Fabrizio Frasca is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Technion, working with Prof. Haggai Maron on Geometric Deep Learning, with a focus on equivariance, expressiveness, and Graph Neural Networks. 
He co-organizes GLOW (Graph Learning on Wednesdays), a reading group on graph learning.

Fabrizio holds a PhD in Computing from Imperial College London, where he worked with Prof. Michael Bronstein on addressing the representational limitations of Graph Neural Networks, exploring meso-scale topology and equivariance as design principles for expressive architectures.

Previously, he was a Machine Learning Researcher at Twitter Cortex (2019–2023, following the acquisition of Fabula AI). 
His past research includes applied Machine Learning in Computational Biology, particularly drug repurposing and epigenetic gene expression regulation.

## Project

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning and instruction-following abilities on textual data, but how well can they process structured inputs like graphs?

This question is both practically relevant and theoretically intriguing. 
Graphs flexibly model relational systems, structured objects and knowledge – LLMs that natively and effectively handle them would constitute powerful tools for modular and nuanced reasoning thereon. 
Via natural language, users could guide graph-based analyses by providing in-context examples or by breaking down complex tasks into substeps, while grounding Retrieval-Augmented Generation with relational context. 
Studying LLMs on graphs also intersects with tackling computationally hard problems, additionally shedding light on their ability to solve challenging mathematical tasks.

Early research has explored LLMs for graphs, but training-free prompting schemes have shown weak performance [1]. 
Hybrid approaches incorporating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [2,3] offer improvements but either process graphs in a prompt-agnostic way or propose sophisticated architectural modifications and are specific to text-attributed structures. 
An open question remains under-explored: “Can LLMs themselves be effectively instructed to process relational data?”. 
This appears as a plausible possibility given the theoretical expressiveness of their architectural backbone, the massive size of their pretraining corpora, and preliminary, encouraging results [4,5], suggesting, inter-alia, that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve competitive performance compared to Transformers trained from scratch.

The goal of this project is to provide a more systematic analysis on the adaptation of pretrained LLMs for graph tasks, aiming to study whether and how the pre-acquired abilities of LLMs can apply to structured objects with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and no sophisticated architectural changes. 
On these fine-tuned LLMs, we will investigate aspects related to expressiveness, permutation invariance, skill transfer and sample efficiency. 
We will explore whether the architectural biases of LLMs give them an expressiveness edge over standard message-passing GNNs. 
We will also analyse their sensitivity to node orderings – i.e., the extent to which they respect the main graph symmetry – and study the impact of the LLM architectural backbones. 
We will finally assess their robustness to input distributions and explore their ability to tackle unseen tasks with appropriate prompting.
