## Donato Crisostomi

Donato Crisostomi is a researcher at the Sapienza University of Rome, focusing on model merging and representational alignment. 
He currently leads the “Model Reuse” work package for the 1.5M€ project “NEXUS: Interoperable Machine Learning with Universal Representations”. 
He previously held roles as a visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge, a Research Scientist at Amazon Alexa, and an Applied Scientist at Amazon Search. 
His research has been featured in top-tier AI conferences and journals, including CVPR, NeurIPS, ACM, ACL, and LoG. 
In addition to his scientific contributions, he has played an active role in the research community as the organizer of the UniReps workshop at NeurIPS and as a program committee member for leading conferences such as CVPR, NeurIPS, ICLR, etc.


## Project

Machine learning models learn internal representations that capture task-relevant features, commonly believed to be potentially very different from each other. 
Yet recent research suggests that, despite their apparent difference, these learned embeddings might often be transformations of one another—sometimes via simple orthogonal mappings—thereby maintaining inter-sample relationships [1, 2]. 
Such observations hint at the existence of universal representation spaces, large "embeddings hubs" that multiple models can map to while preserving the semantics of their original learned features.

In this project, we plan to investigate whether—and to what extent—universal representation spaces can be identified by leveraging cycle-consistent alignment [3]. 
Concretely, given several trained models, we will explore how to align their latent representations in a way that is robust to differences in architecture, training conditions and possibly even modalities. 
By enforcing cycle consistency, every model's embedding can be mapped to a shared "universe" and back again without drifting away from its original representation. 
This property makes it possible to preserve the local geometric and semantic relationships that each model has learned.

Our research will revolve around three high-level steps. 
First, we will extract intermediate-layer embeddings from each model and define a consistent strategy for sampling representative data points. 
Second, we will develop a cycle-consistent alignment procedure that optimizes mapping functions from one model to another by passing through a universal space. 
Finally, we will evaluate whether the resulting universal space meaningfully captures class separability, domain invariance, or other useful properties across multiple models.

By the end of the program, we aim to have a prototype that tests this idea on a modest set of models and datasets. 
If the results confirm that cycle-consistent transformations do indeed create a faithful universal embedding space, this research is likely to be submitted to a top-tier machine learning conference, as well as open up new avenues for model merging and multi-modal learning.
